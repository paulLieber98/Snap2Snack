# 🔧 Snap2Snack API Key Issues - RESOLVED

## ✅ What I Fixed

### 1. **Removed Hardcoded API Key**
- **Before**: Your API key was hardcoded in `Config.swift` (security risk)
- **After**: API key is now loaded from environment variables only
- **Benefit**: Safe to commit to public repositories

### 2. **Improved API Key Validation**
- **Before**: Validation logic was flawed and would always pass
- **After**: Proper validation checks:
  - ✅ Not empty
  - ✅ Not placeholder text
  - ✅ Starts with "sk-"
  - ✅ Has sufficient length (>20 characters)

### 3. **Better Error Messages**
- **Before**: Generic "Analysis failed" messages
- **After**: Clear, actionable error messages with setup instructions

### 4. **Added Debug Tools**
- Created `test_api_key.sh` script to verify configuration
- Added `apiKeyStatus` property for debugging
- Created comprehensive setup guide (`API_KEY_SETUP.md`)

## 🚀 How to Fix Your "Analysis Failed" Issue

### Step 1: Get Your OpenAI API Key
1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Sign up/login and create a new API key
3. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variable in Xcode
1. Open your project in Xcode
2. Go to **Product → Scheme → Edit Scheme...**
3. Select **Run** in the left sidebar
4. Go to **Arguments** tab
5. Under **Environment Variables**, click the **+** button
6. Add:
   - **Name**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: `your-actual-api-key-here` (paste your real key)
7. Click **Close**

### Step 3: Test Your Setup
```bash
# Run this in your terminal
./test_api_key.sh
```

### Step 4: Build and Run
1. Clean and build your project in Xcode
2. Run the app
3. Try taking a photo - you should now see AI analysis!

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If you still get "Analysis failed":
1. **Check environment variable**: Run `./test_api_key.sh`
2. **Restart Xcode**: After setting environment variables
3. **Verify API key**: Make sure it starts with `sk-` and is complete
4. **Check credits**: Ensure your OpenAI account has sufficient credits

### Common Issues:
- **"API key doesn't start with 'sk-'"**: You copied the wrong text
- **"API key seems too short"**: You didn't copy the complete key
- **"No API key found"**: Environment variable not set in Xcode
